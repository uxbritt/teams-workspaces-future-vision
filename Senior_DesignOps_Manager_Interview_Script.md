## Manager's Direction
*"Make sure this person can think across all facets of design ops - managing scope and work for the team, FIGMA organization, design research ops, helping me measure the success of our team."*

---

## SECTION 1: Welcome & Setup (2 minutes)

"Thanks for making time today. I'm [NAME], and I lead [TEAM/ROLE]. We have 30 minutes, so I want to make this focused and valuable for both of us. I'm going to ask you about four key areas: managing scope and work, Figma organization, research ops, and measuring team success. Then we'll leave time for your questions. Sound good?"

*If candidate wants to give background:* "I've reviewed your background—very relevant experience. Let's dive right into the work."

---

## SECTION 2: Scope & Work Management (7 minutes)

**Q1: Portfolio Management & Capacity**

"Walk me through how you've managed scope and work allocation across a design team. How do you track capacity, prioritize requests, and ensure designers are working on the right things?"

**Listen for:**
- Concrete systems/tools (not just theory)
- Partnership with design leadership
- Prioritization frameworks
- Visibility/transparency mechanisms
- How they say "no" or manage tradeoffs

**Follow-up:** "What happens when you have more requests than capacity? Walk me through your process."

---

**Q2: Keeping Work Moving**

"Tell me about a time when work was getting stuck or slowed down across the design team. How did you diagnose it and what did you do?"

**Listen for:**
- Problem diagnosis skills
- Root cause analysis (not surface symptoms)
- Cross-functional coordination (Product, Eng)
- Measurable improvement
- Systemic vs. one-off fixes

**Quick probe:** "How did you know it was fixed?"

---

## SECTION 3: Figma Organization (6 minutes)

**Q3: Figma Governance at Scale**

"Describe your experience organizing and governing Figma across a design team. What's your approach to file structure, libraries, permissions, and keeping things from becoming chaos?"

**Listen for:**
- **Deep Figma expertise** (this is critical)
- Naming conventions, file architecture
- Component library management
- Version control and branching strategies
- Team training and adoption
- Balance of structure vs. flexibility

**Follow-up:** "What's the biggest Figma organization challenge you've solved?"

---

**Q4: Design System Operations**

"How do you approach the operational side of design systems—specifically maintaining libraries, governing contributions, and keeping designers aligned?"

**Listen for:**
- DS ops experience (maintenance, not just building)
- Contribution models
- Documentation strategy
- Designer enablement
- Relationship between DS and product teams

---

## SECTION 4: Research Ops & Cross-Functional Thinking (6 minutes)

**Q5: Research Operations**

"What's your experience with research operations? How do you support researchers and integrate research into the broader design ops ecosystem?"

**Listen for:**
- **ResearchOps fundamentals** (participant management, tools, repositories)
- Integration with design workflows
- Knowledge management (insights don't disappear)
- Recruiting, incentives, scheduling
- Cross-functional use of research
- If limited experience: willingness to learn and logical approach

**Probe:** "How do you make research findings accessible and actionable across Product and Design?"

---

**Q6: Holistic Thinking**

"Design ops touches a lot of areas—tools, process, people, systems. How do you decide what to focus on and ensure you're not just solving isolated problems?"

**Listen for:**
- **Systems thinking** (sees connections)
- Prioritization based on impact
- Strategic vs. reactive work
- How they balance multiple domains
- Listening to the team vs. imposing solutions

---

## SECTION 5: Measuring Team Success (6 minutes)

**Q7: Metrics & Reporting**

"How have you helped design leadership measure the success and impact of the design team? What metrics have you tracked, and how did you report them?"

**Listen for:**
- **Specific metrics** (velocity, quality, satisfaction, business impact)
- Qualitative + quantitative balance
- Dashboards, reporting cadence
- Storytelling with data
- Metrics that drive action (not vanity metrics)
- Partnership with leadership to define success

**Probe:** "Give me an example of a metric you tracked that led to a change in how the team operated."

---

**Q8: Operational Health**

"Beyond team output, how do you measure the health of design operations itself? How do you know if your ops work is succeeding?"

**Listen for:**
- Self-awareness and feedback loops
- Designer satisfaction/sentiment
- Process adoption rates
- Time savings, friction reduction
- Stakeholder feedback (Product, Eng)
- Continuous improvement mindset

---

### Green Flags to Look For:

## Interview Tips

**Time Management (Critical for 30 min)**
- Start on time, keep tight control
- Cut off stories politely: "That's helpful, let me ask you about..."
- Skip background/origin story unless it adds value
- If they answer multiple questions in one response, acknowledge and move on

**What You're Really Assessing**
1. Can they **manage the work** (capacity, prioritization, visibility)?
2. Do they **know Figma cold** (this is table stakes)?
3. Can they **think across domains** (not just one area)?
4. Will they **help us measure** what matters?

**Key Question to Ask Yourself:**
*"Will this person make the design team more effective and make my job as a manager easier?"*
